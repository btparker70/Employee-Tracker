# What I learned

This project got me more familiar with MySql and how to access those tables through node.js. I learned how to organize the loadouts of these tables, how to rename columns and practice doing inner and left joins. I also got to work with console.table for the first time and used the refined npm packet for it to give a more clean loadout.
